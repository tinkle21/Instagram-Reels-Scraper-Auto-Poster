## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: Can I run Reels-AutoPilot on a Raspberry Pi or similar devices?

A: Yes, Reels-AutoPilot can be run on a Raspberry Pi or any other device that supports Python 3.x and the required dependencies. However, you may need to adjust the configuration and installation steps to match the specific requirements of your device.

#### Q: Can I use Reels-AutoPilot for commercial purposes?

A: Reels-AutoPilot is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0, which allows you to use, modify, and distribute the software for both personal and commercial purposes. However, you must comply with the terms of the license, which includes providing the source code for any modifications you make and preserving the original copyright notices.

#### Q: Is it safe to use my Instagram account credentials with Reels-AutoPilot?

A: Reels-AutoPilot stores your Instagram account credentials in the `config.py` file, and they are used only for authenticating and posting reels andshorts to your account. However, make sure to keep your credentials secure and not share them with unauthorized parties. It is also recommended to use a secondary Instagram account for testing purposes before using your main account.

#### Q: Can I post reels and shorts from private Instagram accounts or YouTube channels?

A: Reels-AutoPilot can only scrape reels from public Instagram accounts and shorts from public YouTube channels. If you want to post content from private accounts or channels, you will need to obtain the necessary permissions and access to the content.

#### Q: Can I get banned from Instagram for using Reels-AutoPilot?

A: Reels-AutoPilot automates the process of posting reels and shorts to your Instagram account. While automation can potentially violate Instagram's terms of service, Reels-AutoPilot is designed to minimize the risk of getting banned by posting at regular intervals and not spamming your account. However, it is still recommended to use Reels-AutoPilot responsibly and at your own risk.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Issue**: Reels-AutoPilot is not scraping reels or shorts correctly.

   **Solution**: Ensure that the Instagram account usernames and YouTube channel links in `config.py` are correct and publicly accessible. Also, make sure that your YouTube API key is valid and has not exceeded the quota limits.

2. **Issue**: Reels-AutoPilot is not posting reels and shorts to my Instagram account.

   **Solution**: Verify that your Instagram account credentials in `config.py` are correct and that your account has not been banned or restricted. Additionally, check the `POSTING_INTERVAL_IN_MIN` and `SCRAPER_INTERVAL_IN_MIN` settings to ensure they are set to appropriate values.

3. **Issue**: I am receiving an error when running Reels-AutoPilot with Docker.

   **Solution**: Make sure you have properly installed and configured Docker on your system. Double-check the Docker build and run commands to ensure they are executed correctly. If the issue persists, consider running Reels-AutoPilot without Docker.

If you continue to face issues or need further assistance, please open an issue on the GitHub repository or reach out to the community for support.
